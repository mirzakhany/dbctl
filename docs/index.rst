dbctl's documentation!
=================================

DBCTL is a tool designed to make running a database in a Docker container easy and fast. It offers the following features:

- Run a database with applied migration files and sample data.
- Access the connection URL and use your preferred tools to connect to the database.
- Launch a user interface (UI) for managing the database, if available.
- Enable users to quickly run tests in a fresh database.
- Cleanup databases once you're finished using them!

.. warning:: DBCTL is not intended for running databases in production. Its primary purpose is to simplify testing and practice with no hassle.
